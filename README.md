# Live Schedule Dashboard

## Shared schedule backend for display devices

The dashboard can publish its normalized schedule to the shared schedule backend so `card_view.html` and `index_display.html` work on other devices without access to the operator's browser.

1. On the dashboard, use **Shared schedule backend** to save the HTTPS API base URL, then sign in with the backend admin username and password. The dashboard stores the base URL and returned JWT only in that browser's `localStorage`; it never stores the password or includes credentials in generated links.
2. Upload CSV files as usual. The dashboard keeps its local schedule behavior and also atomically publishes the normalized merged rows to `PUT {baseUrl}/api/admin/schedule` with the saved JWT. A backend error is shown if publishing fails.
3. Open the DC or CDC card buttons to get a stable display link. It retains the selected team, search, and role filters and contains only `api=<public-base-url>`, for example:

   `card_view.html?team=DC&api=https%3A%2F%2Fschedule.example.com`

The link has no token and no date, so the same bookmarked link receives later uploads from public `GET {baseUrl}/api/schedule` on its normal one-minute refresh. To use the unattended display, append the same public API base:

`index_display.html?api=https%3A%2F%2Fschedule.example.com`

## Sharing the full dashboard

To let another PC open the complete dashboard without entering an API URL or signing in, save the shared backend API base in **Shared schedule backend**, then select **Copy dashboard link**. The copied URL is based on the current dashboard page and has exactly one query parameter:

`https://dashboard.example.com/?api=https%3A%2F%2Fschedule.example.com`

Opening that link validates and canonicalizes the HTTPS API base, saves it in that browser's `localStorage` for later visits, and immediately loads public `GET {baseUrl}/api/schedule`. It contains no JWT, username, password, or other credentials. An invalid `api` value is ignored and the browser continues with its configured backend and static-schedule fallback behavior.

The backend API response is `{ version, updated_at, rows }`. The shared backend is the supported setup for publishing and displaying schedules. The display pages use the backend first, then `schedule.json`; older external display links that include a public Gist ID remain readable for backward compatibility. They do not send authentication headers or credentials.

The backend must allow the GitHub Pages origin and the `Authorization` and `Content-Type` request headers through CORS. Removing the backend connection in the dashboard removes its API base and admin session from that browser only.

## Shared safety badges

Uploading a safety workbook still saves the normalized first-aid, fire-marshal, and working-at-height mappings in the operator browser. When the shared backend is configured and the operator is signed in, the dashboard also atomically publishes `{ badges }` to `PUT {baseUrl}/api/admin/safety-badges`; publish success or failure is shown without discarding the local result. **Clear safety badges** publishes the corresponding empty mapping when signed in and explicitly warns if that shared clear fails.

Card and unattended display links with `api=<public-base-url>` load `GET {baseUrl}/api/safety-badges` alongside the public schedule API and render the same three safety badges. Badge reads are public and never include an admin token; if the badge endpoint is unavailable, each page retains its local/static behavior.
